# Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling (SPIDAM)

## Summary
**WAV*I*Z** is a waveform visualization tool that extracts useful data from audio files. It will start as a highly specialized tool designed with scalability in mind. The specifics of the project will be discussed further in later sections.
is a Python-based project that focuses on analyzing and improving the acoustics of enclosed spaces by measuring reverberation time (RT60). This project employs Python libraries and a graphical user interface to import, clean, visualize, and model acoustic data, ultimately enhancing voice intelligibility.

### Running the Application

#### Run the main application:
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Input Parameters:
- Audio file input: WAV or MP3 formats
- Desired output plots for waveform and RT60 analysis
- GUI-driven data cleaning, analysis, and reporting

#### Example Workflow:
1. Load a sample file via the GUI.
2. Analyze RT60 values and identify problematic frequency ranges.
3. Export results, including visualizations and statistics, to a report.
